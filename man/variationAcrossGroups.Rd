\usage{
variationAcrossGroups(df, categoricalCols, measureColumn,
  plotGroupDifferences = FALSE, returnGroupStats = TRUE,
  returnBoxplotStats = FALSE, dateCol = NULL,
  levelOfDateGroup = "monthly", sigLevel = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing group and measure columns.}

\item{categoricalCols}{Character. Vector containing the name(s) of column(s) to group by.}

\item{measureColumn}{Character. The name of the numeric variable of interest.}

\item{plotGroupDifferences}{Optional. Logical. Plot mean differences between groups 
and confidence intervals from Tukey's HSD? Default is FALSE.}

\item{returnGroupStats}{Optional. Logical. In addition to the model summary table, 
return summary statistics for each group? Default is TRUE.}

\item{returnBoxplotStats}{Optional. Logical. Returns statistics behind the boxplot? 
Defalut is FALSE.}

\item{dateCol}{Optional. Date. A date(time) column to group by (grouped by month by default).}

\item{levelOfDateGroup}{Optional. Character. Level at which to group dateCol. 
One of "yearly", "quarterly", "monthly" (default), or "weekly".}

\item{sigLevel}{Optional. Numeric value between zero and one giving the alpha 
value for Tukey HSD test, i.e. the p-value threshold for significance.}
}
\value{
By default, a list of two data frames giving model and group summary 
statistics respectively. If returnGroupStats is FALSE, just the model summary table. 
Always induces the side effect of printing a boxplot to compare variation across groups.
}
\description{
Compare variation among groups on a continuous measure. Plot boxplot and
 perform ANOVA with Tukey's HSD statistical test to compare variation in a 
 numeric variable (measureColumn) across groups (categoricalCols).

# Create a toy data set

                               prob =  c(0.5, 0.3, 0.2)),
                 Age = factor(rbinom(50, 1, 0.45), labels = c("Young","Old")),
                 Gender = factor(rbinom(50, 1, 0.45), labels = c("Male","Female")),
                 LOS = floor(abs(rnorm(n,10,5))),

# Call the function
variationAcrossGroups(df = df, 
                      categoricalCols = c("Dept", "Age"),
                      measureColumn = "LOS", 
                      plotGroupDifferences = TRUE)
                       
# Since plotGroupDifferences = TRUE and the default of returnGroupStats is TRUE, the function 
# above prints the boxplot and the 95\% family-wise confidence interval plot, and
# returns the summary statistics tables. The two plots show:

# 1. The boxplot of LOS across all combinations of the two categories, Dept and Age.
#    Dept has 3 levels: Dept1, Dept2, Dept3
#    Age has 2 levels: Young and Old
#    Hence, there are a total of 6 different groupings, which are shown on
#    the x axis of the boxplot. 
#    Groups that have a shared letter are *not* significantly different. 
#    For example, groups Dept1 | Young and Dept2 | Young are not significantly
#    different becauese they share an "a".
#    On the other hand, Dept2 | Young and Dept3 | Young are significantly 
#    different because they do not share a label letter.
#    not have a significant difference in mean.
# 
# 2. Confidence-interval level plot
#    This plot present the results of the Tukey's Honest Significant Differences test. 
#    It compares all possible pairs of groups and adjusts p-values for multiple comparisons.
#    Red lines indicate a significant difference between the two groups at the chosen 
#    significance level (0.05 by default). Groups are ordered by p-values.

###################### Example 2 ######################
# This data set has two columns, some measured blood value, and an anesthetic treatment.
# There are five anesthetics in the dataset: Midazolam, Propofol, Ketamine, Thiamylal, and Diazepam.
set.seed(35)
df1 <- data.frame(
  anesthetic = c(rep("Midazolam", 50) , rep("Propofol", 20) , rep("Ketamine", 40) , 
                 rep("Thiamylal", 80) ,  rep("Diazepam", 20)),
  value = c( sample(2:5, 50 , replace = TRUE) , sample(6:10, 20 , replace = TRUE), 
        sample(1:7, 40 , replace = TRUE), sample(3:10, 80 , replace = TRUE) , 
        sample(10:20, 20 , replace = TRUE) )
)                      
head(df1)

variationAcrossGroups(df1, "anesthetic", "value",  returnGroupStats = FALSE, sigLevel = .01)
# The boxplot tells us that anesthetic Diazepam has a significantly different mean from 
# all the other treatments at alpha = 0.01. Midazolam and Ketamine are not significantly different,
# so they share the letter "a"; likewise for the Propofol and Thiamylal groups.
# The means of Midazolam and Ketamine are significantly different from Propofol and Thiamylal.
