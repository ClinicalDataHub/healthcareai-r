\title{Split data into training and test data frames}
\usage{
split_train_test(d, outcome, percent_train = 0.8, seed, grouping_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Data frame}

\item{outcome}{Target column, unquoted. Split will be stratified across this
variable}

\item{percent_train}{Proportion of rows in d to put into training. Default is 0.8}

\item{seed}{Optional, if provided the function will return the same split
each time it is called}

\item{grouping_col}{column header of dataframe to base grouping split}
}
\value{
A list of two data frames with names train and test
}
\description{
Split data into training and test data frames
}
\details{
This function wraps `caret::createDataPartition`. If outcome is a factor
  then the test/training porportions are stratified. Otherwise they are randomly
  selected. If the grouping_col is given, then groups are kept together where possible.
  If grouping is prefered over stratified split, then make sure that outcome is
  not a factor.
