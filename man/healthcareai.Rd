\title{healthcareai: a streamlined way to develop and deploy models}
\description{
healthcareai provides a clean interface to create and compare multiple
models on your data and then deploy the model that is most accurate. healthcareai
also includes functions for data exploration, data cleaning, and model evaluation.
}
\details{
This is done in a three-step process: First, Loading, profiling, and feature 
engineering. Second, developing a model. Third, deploying and monitoring the 
model.

\enumerate{
\item{\strong{Load and profile data}}{\cr
\itemize{
\item{Loading Data:}
\itemize{
\item Use \code{\link{selectData}} to pull data directrly from a SQL 
database}
\item{Profiling Data:}
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{featureAvailabilityProfiler}} will find how much data is 
present in each variable over time.
\item \code{\link{countMissingData}} finds the proportion of missing data in 
each variable.
\item \code{\link{findVariation}} and \code{\link{variationAcrossGroups}} are
 used to find variation across/between subgroups of data.
\item \code{\link{findTrends}} finds trends that are six months or longer.
\item \code{\link{calculateTargetedCorrelations}} will calculate correlations
 for all numeric columns and a specified variable of interest.
\item \code{\link{orderByDate}} will sort your data frame by date.
\item \code{\link{isBinary}} will check if a column is only two values.
\item \code{\link{KmeansClustering}} used to cluster data with or without an
outcome variable}}
}

\item{\strong{Develop a machine learning model}}{\cr
\itemize{
\item{Models:}
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{LassoDevelopment}}: Used for regression or classification 
and does an especially good job with a lot of variables.
\item \code{\link{RandomForestDevelopment}}: Used for regression or 
classification and is well suited to non-linear data.
\item \code{\link{XGBoostDevelopment}}: Used for multi-class classification
(problems where there are more than 2 classes). Well suited to non-linear 
data.
\item \code{\link{LinearMixedModelDevelopment}}: Best suited for longitudinal
data and datasets with less than 100k rows and 50 variables. Can do
classification or regression.
}
\item{Performance of Trained Models:}
\itemize{
\item Area under the ROC curve or area under the Performance-Recall curve are 
 used to evaluate the performance of classification models.
\item The Mean squared error(MSE) and root mean squared error(RMSE) are used 
to evaluate the performance of regression problems.
}
}
Models will be automatically saved in the working directory after creation.
}

\item{\strong{Deploy the machine learning model}}{\cr
\code{\link{LassoDeployment}}, \code{\link{LinearMixedModelDevelopment}}, 
\code{\link{RandomForestDeployment}}, or \code{\link{XGBoostDeployment}} to
load the model from development and predict against test data.  Push
predicted values into a SQL environment with \code{\link{writeData}}. The
deployments can be tested locally, but eventually live on the production 
server.}

\item{\strong{Monitor performance in production environment}}{\cr After 
generating predictions and getting ground truth values, use 
\code{\link{generateAUC}} to monitor performance over time. This should 
happen after the predictions can be validated with the result. If you're 
predicting 30-day readmissions, you can't validate until 30 days have passed 
since the predictions.}
