**Deploying a model**

Now that you've put in the work of building a model and it's performing well on historical data, congratulations! It's time to think about how to set it up to make reoccurring predictions. At this point, you have:

- Decided on an algorithm
- Decided on your feature (i.e., input variable) list
- A model that meets performance requirements

# Saving a model

In order to work with models in a production environment, first you must be able to have a saved model on disk. Here's how that's done--pay attention to line 

```{r}
library(healthcareai)
library(DBI)
library(tidyverse)
my_con <- build_connection_string(server = "HCS-GM0004",
                                  database = "SAM",
                                  trusted = TRUE)
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), .connection_string = my_con)

train_query <- "SELECT [FacilityAccountID]
                ,[AdmitAgeNBR]
                ,[GenderCD]
                ,[EthnicGroupDSC]
                ,[MaritalStatusDSC]
                ,[Readmit30FLG]
  FROM [SAM].[SSISTest].[SummaryVisitBASE]"

d <- db_read(con, train_query)

models <- machine_learn(d = d, 
                       FacilityAccountID,
                       models = "rf",
                       outcome = Readmit30FLG)

# Save my model
save(models, file = "readmit_models.RDA")
```

# Pushing predictions to a table

While the frequency may vary depending on the use case, new patients or patient encounters (i.e., rows) will need predictions on a reoccurring basis. In healthcare, _daily_ batch predictions are common. To create predictions, these new rows are run against the model that lives in the RDA file. 

Instead of slimply creating predictions in R, however, in a production scenario you'll be pushing these predictions to a database. Typically we append to the same table each night, such that a person will get an updated risk score for each day they're in the hospital (for example).

# Creating predictions

Now we focus on the code that will run each night to create predictions. Note a couple of things:

- The query is different from the development step--here you're only querying patients that need a prediction
- We read the model from disk; if needed, a web service could be involved


```{r}
prod_query <- "SELECT [FacilityAccountID]
                ,[AdmitAgeNBR]
                ,[GenderCD]
                ,[EthnicGroupDSC]
                ,[MaritalStatusDSC]
                ,[Readmit30FLG]
FROM [SAM].[SSISTest].[SummaryVisitBASE]"

d_out <- db_read(con, prod_query)

load("readmit_models.RDA")

predictions <- predict(models, d_out)
```

# Create the output table

Before we create the output table, let's see what our predictions look like:

```{r}
glimpse(predictions)
```

You might want push fewer columns to a table each night. Here's how you slim this down:

```{r}
predictions <- predictions %>% 
  select(FacilityAccountID, predicted_Readmit30FLG) %>% # Grab just two columns
  rename(PredictedProbability = predicted_Readmit30FLG) # Change col name
```

Now that we have only the columns necessary, let's and populate the output table

## For folks outside of a Health Catalyst environment

Use a tool like SQL Server Management Studio and a `CREATE` statement

## For folks in a Health Catalyst environment

1. Append a few utility columns to your output

```{r}
predictions <- predictions %>%
  add_SAM_utility_cols
```

2. Use Source Area Mart Designer (SAMD) to create the table (since this creates metadata)
  - This binding requires a query that not only has the column structure, but also `WHERE 0 = 1`, such that only R is populating the output table

# Push predictions to the table

Here we use the `RODBC` package, which can be installed via `install.packages('RODBC')`

```{r}
library(RODBC)

sqlSave(con, 
        predictions, 
        "TestSchema.TestTable", 
        append = TRUE, 
        rownames = FALSE)

odbcClose(con)
```




# Testing in production


Note: for those working in a Health Catalyst environment, proceed with the ML-Prod document in Spark
