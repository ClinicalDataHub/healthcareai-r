# Preliminary Plans

Well, we've had a couple of R Reading groups!

Summary:
- We'd like to use tidyverse. Main advantage: It's the reason R is a modern language. One way or another, we are going to end up with tidyverse in there.
- S3 is Simple, Specific, and Supported. Goodbye R6. Why did we go that way original. 
- We'd like to add lintR (code quality for R packages)
- 



We want to be super terse with variable names. no. not that. verbose. There we go.

We are using R6. uhh. S3.

We are going to use sublime to do the development. Tidyverse, thank you.
