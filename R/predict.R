#' Make predictions using the best-performing model from tuning
#'
#' @param object model_list object, as from `tune_models`
#' @param newdata data on which to make predictions. If missing, predictions
#'   will be made on the training data. Should have the same structure as the
#'   input to `prep_data`,`tune_models` or `train_models`. `predict` will try to
#'   figure out if the data need to be sent through `prep_data` before making
#'   predictions; this can be overriden by setting `prepdata = FALSE`, but this
#'   should rarely be needed.
#' @param prepdata Logical, this should rarely be set by the user. By default,
#'   if `newdata` hasn't been prepped, it will be prepped by `prep_data` before
#'   predictions are made. Set this to TRUE to force already-prepped data
#'   through `prep_data` again, or set to FALSE to prevent `newdata` from being
#'   sent through `prep_data`.
#' @param ... Unused.
#'
#' @return A tibble data frame: newdata with an additional column for the
#'   predictions in "predicted_TARGET" where TARGET is the name of the variable
#'   being predicted. If classification, the new column will contain predicted
#'   probabilities. The tibble will have child class "hcai_predicted_df" and
#'   attribute "model_info" that contains information about the model used to
#'   make predictions.

#' @details The model and hyperparameter values with the best out-of-fold
#'   performance in model training according to the selected metric is used to
#'   make predictions. Prepping data inside `predict` has the advantage of
#'   returning your predictions with the newdata in its original format.
