Using recipes to do data prep is awesome. I think our primary value add will be
custom recipes to clean and prepare, and custom steps to do things like add
`hcai_missing` as a factor level.

- A recipe is a exactly that. It's a process to transform data. Only the 
process.
- `prep` will gather the ingredients needed to apply the recipe. Example: One
must know the mean before centering.
- `bake` actually applies the recipe. Any subset of the same data can be 
baked with the recipe.

Basic examples can be found here:
https://github.com/topepo/recipes/blob/master/vignettes/Simple_Example.Rmd

Custom step examples can be found here:

Or below for some starter code.

```{r}
library(caret)
library(recipes)
library(tidyverse)
library(healthcareai)
```


Load a diabetes dataset. Download from `Box/Data Science Team/Classification/diabetes.csv`
```{r}
df <- as.tibble(read.csv("diabetic_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE))

df$X <- NULL

# Change to binary
df$readmitted[df$readmitted==">30"] <- "N"
df$readmitted <- as.factor(ifelse(df$readmitted == "<30", "Y", "N"))

# Replace ? with NA
df[df == "?"] <- NA

cols_to_factor <- c("race", "gender", "admission_type_id", "discharge_disposition_id",
  "admission_source_id", "payer_code", "medical_specialty", "diag_1", "diag_2", "diag_3", 
  "metformin", "repaglinide", "nateglinide", "chlorpropamide", "glimepiride", 
  "acetohexamide", "glipizide","glyburide","tolbutamide","pioglitazone","rosiglitazone",
  "acarbose","miglitol","troglitazone","tolazamide","examide","citoglipton","insulin",
  "glyburide.metformin","glipizide.metformin","glimepiride.pioglitazone","metformin.rosiglitazone",
  "metformin.pioglitazone","change","diabetesMed", "readmitted")
df[cols_to_factor] <- lapply(df[cols_to_factor], as.factor)

df$age <- factor(df$age, ordered = TRUE)

df[c("weight", "max_glu_serum", "A1Cresult")] <- lapply(
  df[c("weight", "max_glu_serum", "A1Cresult")], as.numeric)

data <- df %>% slice(1:20000)

glimpse(data)

print("size of dataset:")
print(dim(data))

print("unique patients:")
print(length(unique(data$patient_nbr)))

print("missing percentage:")
print(countMissingData(data))

print("structure:")
print(str(data))
```

Train test split
Splitting on the readmitted flag makes sure that the distribution is the same in both sets.
```{r}
train_index <- createDataPartition(data$readmitted,
  p = 0.8,
  times = 1,
  list = TRUE)

data_train <- data[train_index$Resample1, ]
data_test <- data[-train_index$Resample1, ]
```


### Basic Recipe
Use `?selections` to see how to select certain variables. One can select by type, role, or name
This one does centering and scaling of numeric variables.
```{r}
# Initialize
rec_obj <- recipe(readmitted ~ ., data = data)

# Create recipe
standardized <- rec_obj %>%
  step_center(all_numeric()) %>%
  step_scale(all_numeric()) 
standardized

# Train recipe
trained_rec <- prep(standardized, training = data_train)

# Apply recipe
data_train <- bake(trained_rec, newdata = data_train)
data_test  <- bake(trained_rec, newdata = data_test)
```

Add more steps with by just adding to the trained recipe. Get a list of steps using `apropos("^step_")`
```{r}
apropos("^step_")
```

Updating a recipe
```{r}
# Update recipe
trained_rec <- trained_rec %>%
  step_nzv(all_predictors())

# Train updated recipe (recall that you'll have to start with a fresh copy of
# data_train to apply the recipe from the beginning).
data_train <- data[train_index$Resample1, ]
data_test <- data[-train_index$Resample1, ]
trained_rec <- prep(trained_rec, training = data_train)

# Apply recipe
data_train <- bake(trained_rec, newdata = data_train)
data_test  <- bake(trained_rec, newdata = data_test)
```

Dummification
```{r}
# Update recipe
trained_rec <- trained_rec %>%
  step_dummy(starts_with("gender"))

# Train updated recipe
data_train <- data[train_index$Resample1, ]
data_test <- data[-train_index$Resample1, ]
trained_rec <- prep(trained_rec, training = data_train)

# Apply recipe
data_train <- bake(trained_rec, newdata = data_train)
data_test  <- bake(trained_rec, newdata = data_test)
```

## Adding a custom step
Factors should get a level called, `hcai_missing`. Then, NA values should be set to this value. If there are no missing values, this column will still generate a dummy column. To do this, we need a custom recipes function.

```{r}
# This is the user-facing function
step_hcai_missing <- function(recipe, 
                              ..., 
                              role = NA, 
                              trained = FALSE,
                              na_percentage = NULL) {
  terms <- rlang::quos(...) 
  if (length(terms) == 0)
    stop("Please supply at least one variable specification. See ?selections.")
  add_step(
    recipe, 
    step_hcai_missing_new(
      terms = terms,
      role = role,
      trained = trained,
      na_percentage = na_percentage
    )
  )
}

# Initialze a new object
step_hcai_missing_new <- function(terms = NULL, 
                                  role = NA, 
                                  trained = FALSE,
                                  na_percentage = NULL) {
  step(
    subclass = "hcai_missing", 
    terms = terms,
    role = role,
    trained = trained,
    na_percentage = na_percentage
  )
}

# prep method
prep.step_hcai_missing <- function(x, training, info = NULL, ...) {
  col_names <- terms_select(terms = x$terms, info = info)
  na_percentage <- sapply(training[, col_names], function(x) {
    100 * round(sum(is.na(x)) / length(x), 3)
    }
  )
  
  step_hcai_missing_new(
    terms = x$terms,
    role = x$role,
    trained = TRUE,
    na_percentage = na_percentage
  )
}

# bake method
bake.step_hcai_missing <- function(object, newdata, ...) {
  vars <- names(object$na_percentage)
  
  for (i in vars) {
    # Add missing level
    levs <- levels(newdata[[i]])
    levels(newdata[[i]]) <- c(levs, "hcai_missing")
    
    # Set NA to the new level
    newdata[is.na(newdata[, i]), i] <- "hcai_missing"
  }
  ## Always convert to tibbles on the way out
  tibble::as_tibble(newdata)
}
```


Give it a try.
```{r}
rec_obj2 <- recipe(readmitted ~ ., data = data)

rec_obj2 <- rec_obj2 %>%
  step_hcai_missing(starts_with("medical_sp"))

data_train <- data[train_index$Resample1, ]
data_test <- data[-train_index$Resample1, ]
rec_obj2 <- prep(rec_obj2, training = data_train)

out <- bake(rec_obj2, data_train)
out
```

```{r}
# Initialize
rec_obj <- recipe(readmitted ~ ., data = data)

# Create recipe
standardized <- rec_obj %>%
  step_center(all_numeric()) %>%
  step_scale(all_numeric()) %>%
  step_hcai_missing(all_nominal())

# Train recipe
data_train <- data[train_index$Resample1, ]
data_test <- data[-train_index$Resample1, ]
trained_rec <- prep(standardized, training = data_train)

# Apply recipe
data_train <- bake(trained_rec, newdata = data_train)
data_test  <- bake(trained_rec, newdata = data_test)
```

## Ordering
Suggested order of potential steps:
1. Impute
2. Individual transformations for skewness and other issues
3. Discretize (if needed and if you have no other choice)
4. Create dummy variables
5. Create interactions
6. Normalization steps (center, scale, range, etc)
7. Multivariate transformation (e.g. PCA, spatial sign, etc)
